# Universal-Finite-Automata-Simulator

This project's purpose is to implement a universal FA, and then simulate a number of finite state automata (one by one)
from this universal FA. To simulate a specific FA, the universal FA will take a set of states, a set of final
states, an alphabet set, and a sequence of transitions (i.e. the transition table) of the specific FA as inputs.
Then, this specific FA will be able to recognize whether a string belongs to the corresponding language or not
(i.e. Accept or Reject a string.) This method provides a general way of implementing different kinds of finite automata.
